<br><br>
  

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
The Fremont Reformation has created this <b>T.R.O.I. Rulings (Card-Specific) V 2.4</b> repository in order to codify and clarify the latest card-specific rulings for <i>Star Trek: Attack Wing</i> when played in Fremont Reformation events. Other groups are welcome to make use of this repository as well. It is not an official WizKids document. General rules of play are in the <b>TROI Rulebook V 2.4</b>.
<br><br>
This TROI Card Specific Rulings repository is split into three main sections, each of which has its own numerical range: <br><br>
<hr>
<b>> 28 - All of the card-specific rulings whose number starts with 28 are summaries of official WizKids rulings, mostly from WORF. All of these rulings have links provided. </b>
<hr> 
<b><p class="blue-text">> 29 - All of the card-specific rulings whose number starts with 29 are clarifications made by the Fremont Reformation Rule Committee for specific cards, in resposne to queries from group members. We believe that they are still adhering strictly to WizKids rules. </p></b>
<hr> 
<b><p class="red-text">> 30 - All of the card-specific rulings whose number starts with 30 are rulings made by TROI in the absence of applicable or acceptable rulings from WizKids. For these rulings, we are unsure whether WizKids would agree with them. You can think of them like "house rules".</p></b>

    In the case that both players have <b>LURIN'S BIRD-OF-PREY</b> and another Ferengi ship with a Ferengi Captain, and both abilites are activated at the start of the Combat Phase, think of "first" and "second" as Captain Skills that are simply above whatever the highest numerical Captain Skill is. Following that logic, resolve this like any other Captain Skill dispute, and the following sequence of combat would take place: <br>
    <br>
    <i>"First" CS Level:</i> <br>
    (a) Ship with Initiative - <b>LURIN'S BIRD-OF-PREY</b> <br>

    <b>NYOTA UHURA</b> cannot increase the range of an Upgrade beyond Range 3. Her card text says "Max Range 3" and so the entire combined effect cannot exceed Range 3.

  If a card says your ship cannot perform any free actions this round, then you cannot use the card if your ship has already performed a free action this round, and you cannot activate the card via a free action, and once the card has been activated, your ship cannot perform any free actions for the rest of the round.

    <br><br>

When an oversized <b>BORG CUBE</b> class ship selects a [down arrow] maneuver, it executes this by moving forward and then rotation 90° twice, effectively making it a come-about instead of a reverse. The [down arrow] manuever on these ships therefore has a different meaning than it does for other ships.

    <br><br>

If a ship is forced to disable or discard <b>MANEUVERABILITY</b> while it is overlapping a planet token, treat the ship as if it is overlapping an Obstacle for attack and defending purposes. The ship is not required to select a dial maneuver that immediately clears the planet. If during an Activation Phase the ship is already overlapping the planet token and then does not move far enough to completely clear the planet, or is blocked by another ship, treat it as if the ship overlapped an Obstacle during its maneuver (i.e., skip the Perform Action step and roll an attack die for damage.)

The shields of <b>CUBE 384</b> cannot be dropped, disabled, destroyed, bypassed, or ignored by the effects of enemy Upgrades. 
<br><br>
However, the shields of <b>CUBE 384</b> can be destroyed normally when damage is dealt from an attack. In such a case, it is the attack itself (not the effect of an enemy Upgrade) that is affecting the shields. 
<br><br>
Effects from enemy Upgrades that bypass/ignore shields and deal damage directly to the hull, such as <b>CHRONITON TORPEDOES</b>, do not bypass or ignore the shields of <b>CUBE 384</b>. This is true even if the effect does not directly mention shields. Such damage will first be dealt to any active shields of <b>CUBE 384</b>, as in normal attacks.

The <b>QUEEN VESSEL PRIME</b> ship ability can allow its Captain to gain Borg Drone Tokens exceeding their starting number and thereby increase their Captain Skill arbitrarily high.
<br><br>
This ability also allows non-Borg Captains to gain Drone Tokens.
<br><br>
Drone Tokens on a Captain with a printed Captain Skill do not affect that Captain's Captain Skill. They are only present to pay for effects.

Enemy ships only count as being "in your forward firing arc" if they are also within Range 1-3. Therefore, the <b>SOONG</b> ship ability can still trigger even if there are enemy ships in front of it, as long as those ships are all beyond Range 1-3.

When taking the <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action to perform the action of an Upgrade on another ship as a free action, it is the Upgrade's ship that performs that free action, not the ship taking the <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action.
<br><br>
The <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action cannot target the ship that is taking the <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action, because "friendly ship" does not include your own ship.
<br><br>
The <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action does not allow one Upgrade to have its action performed twice on the same ship in the same round.

<b>BORG MISSILE</b> only destroys Active Shields, not Disabled Shields. If any damage would normally be dealt by the <b>BORG MISSILE</b> attack during the Deal Damage step, then instead: 
<br><br>
(a) Defending ship receives exactly one Auxiliary Power Token. <br>
-- AND -- <br>
(b) For each uncanceled hit or critical hit, one Active Shield (if any remain) on the defending ship is destroyed. Excess hits or critical hits will not deal hull damage to the defending ship.

    <b>TEMPORAL VORTEX</b> forces the attacking player to replay the attack starting with the Roll Attack Dice step of the Combat Phase. The attack is made with the same weapon. But if any bonus dice, rerolling of dice, or conversion of dice were used in the first attempt, they may only be used in the second attempt, they may only be used in the second attempt if they normally could be used again later in a round (such as Scan Tokens). Thus, any cards or tokens that (in the first attempt) were discarded, disabled, marked with time tokens, or spent, will remain discarded, disabled, marked with time tokens, or spent.

When a damage card is placed under the <b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b> card, it goes there before and instead of hitting the hull. Therefore it will not add a token to <b>BORG SHIELD MATRIX</b>, which only gains a token from an attack that damages the shields or hull.

When the defending ship has <b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b>, the attacker rolls their dice, the defender modifies the Critical Hits into Hits, and the attacker may then modify their dice, so TORETH may convert a Hit to a Critical Hit.
<br><br>
<b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b> places the Critical Damage card beneath it. The damage card still resolves its effect even though it is placed beneath the upgrade card. Ongoing effects against the ship (like Stunned Helmsman) do not have any effect due to being on the card rather than the ship. But immediate effects (like Direct Hit!) do occur. The Critical Damage Cards with immediate effects are "Direct Hit!", "Power Disruption", "Munitions Failure", and "Minor Explosion".
<br><br>
When the <b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b> card is discarded after taking 4 damage, any Critical Damage Cards beneath it are discarded as well.

Even if <b>DISRUPTOR BOMBARDMENT</b> has no time tokens after the first attack, the second attack would need to be with your Primary Weapon or another Weapon Upgrade.
    <br><br>
    A card effect is an optional effect if it has an "ATTACK:" heading, and so <b>DISRUPTOR BOMBARDMENT</b> is an optional effect.  Optional effects may only be used once per round per ship per card, unless they are WHEN ATTACKING, WHEN DEFENDING, or EACH AND EVERY TIME effects.

    The game text that provides how to flip the face down cards is on <b>KHAN SINGH'S</b> card.  While he is Disabled or Discarded, the face down cards may not be flipped or used (as they have no game text without being flipped).

    You may not place, for example, <b>ENERGY DISSIPATOR</b> on a non-Breen ship under <b>KHAN SINGH</b>, because its text counts as part of its printed cost.  So its printed cost would actually be 5+5=10 and therefore too high.

    If an Upgrade granting additional shields is hidden beneath <b>QUARK</b> on your ship, and is then revealed, the current number of shield tokens assigned to your ship would not change.  However, you could subsequently repair your shields to a new maximum value.

    When determining whether it is legal to place a particular card face down beneath <b>QUARK</b>, you consider the cost of the Upgrade as if you were purchasing it for the ship.  Faction penalties and extra card costs are factored into whether you can place a card beneath <b>QUARK</b>.  Discounts to SP costs can be applied to the card underneath <b>QUARK</b> to make it fulfill the requirements to go under <b>QUARK</b>.
    <br><br>
    Variable cost cards such as <b>DORSAL PHASER ARRAY</b> may not ever be placed under <b>QUARK</b> because they do not have a defined SP cost.  When a card does not have a defined SP cost it may not be affected by, or used with, cards that require it to have a SP value.

    Treat the <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b> as a ship with "universal" faction when considering the cost of any upgrade to place under <b>QUARK</b> if he is on your <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b>. There is no faction penalty but other card text based penalties or restrictions would apply. Example, <b>QUARK</b> on <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b> cannot place <b>CLOAKING DEVICE</b> because the additional cost specified on the <b>CLOAKING DEVICE</b> card would make the upgrade too expensive for <b>QUARK’S</b> limits. The upgrade underneath <b>QUARK</b> is part of his own point cost and does not count toward the 20 points of captain and upgrades that are purchased for the <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b>.

    When you target another ship with <b>THOUGHT MAKER</b>, the opposing player does not see what maneuver the dial was set to until it is time to reveal the targeted ship's dial.  At that point, they decide whether or not to place an Auxiliary Power Token in order to not move.

    <b>TOM PARIS</b> does not allow you to roll defense dice, if you are already rolling no defense dice thanks to effects such as <b>BORG MISSILE</b> or <b>NANCLUS</b>.

    If your ship is rolling -2 attack dice due to using <b>PROJECTED STASIS FIELD</b> earlier in the round, and then it attacks with <b>TORPEDO FUSILLADE</b>, the -2 attack dice modifier is applied to the first of the attack rolls that <b>TORPEDO FUSILLADE</b> grants.
    <br><br>
    When a card ability forces a player to roll fewer attack dice "this round", the player must roll fewer attack dice in total during that round's Combat Phase, starting with the very next time the player rolls attack dice during the Combat Phase.

    <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b> triggers from any movement by your ship (which might be the execution of a maneuver or it might be a Sensor Echo) within Range 1 of the Minefield Token, even if your ship completely exits the trigger area by the end of the movement.  Therefore, <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b> triggers if any part of the ship's base is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token before it moves, or after its final landing position is established at the end of the movement, or both.  And even if neither of these is true, it still triggers if any part of the template used to execute a maneuver is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token.  However, if the maneuver template used to perform a Sensor Echo is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token, that does not suffice on its own to trigger <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b>, as the maneuver template used for a Sensor Echo is not part of "movement".
    <br><br>
    Your ship can trigger <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b> multiple times during a round, for example during execution of a maneuver, and/or performing a Sensor Echo, and/or or additional movement granted by a special ability.
    <br><br>
    After your ship triggers <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b>, an Auxiliary Power Token is immediately placed beside your ship.  You then proceed to the Check For Power Strain step, where Auxiliary Power Tokens may be added or removed depending on the color of the maneuver that was executed.  If this is the initial dial-based maneuver, any "after you move" abilities happen after the Check For Power Strain Step is completed, followed by the Perform Action Step for the active ship.

    <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> triggers if any part of the enemy ship's base is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token after its landing position is established at the end of movement, or if any part of the template used to execute a maneuver is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token.  However, if you start your movement (either a maneuver or a Sensor Echo) already in range of the Minefield Token, and your movement takes you out of Range 1, then <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> does not trigger.  If the maneuver template used to perform a Sensor Echo is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token, that does not suffice on its own to trigger <b>CLOAKED MINES</b>, as that template is not considered to be part of "movement".
    <br><br>
    The effect of <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> allows you to immediately perform a Scan Action "out of sequence" in order to reduce the damage dice roll.  This choice happens before proceeding to the Check For Power Strain step.  The removal of an Auxiliary Power Token from performing a Green Maneuver has not happened yet, so if you already have an Auxiliary Power Token when triggering <b>CLOAKED MINES</b>, you cannot elect to perform a Scan Action "out of sequence", even if you have just executed a Green Maneuver.  Conversely, if you do not have an Auxiliary Power Token and you performed a Red Maneuver that triggered <b>CLOAKED MINES</b>, you have not yet placed an Auxiliary Power Token by your ship from the Red Maneuver, and so you still may elect to perform a Scan Action "out of sequence", prior to receiving the Auxiliary Power Token.
    <br><br>
    Once you have decided whether to perform the "out of sequence" Scan Action, you continue the <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> effect and roll the appropriate number of dice for damage.  Then you proceed to the Check For Power Strain Step, where Auxiliary Power Tokens may be added or removed depending on the color of the executed maneuver.  If this is the initial dial-based maneuver, any "after you move" abilities happen after the Check For Power Strain Step is completed, and you then proceed to the Perform Action Step for the active ship.

Thus the existing <b>KLINGON STARSHIP</b> was discounted from 20 SP to 13 SP because it is also a <b>B'REL CLASS</b> ship with stats of 4-1-3-2, although there were differences in Factions and slots.
    <br><br>
    By contrast, the existing <b>KLINGON/BORG STARSHIP</b> was not automatically discounted from 24 SP.  The discount to 13 SP would only apply if the existing ship had identical stats of 4-1-3-2 to the <b>FERENGI/KLINGON STARSHIP</b>, whereas the <b>KLINGON/BORG STARSHIP</b> has stats of 5-1-3-3.  It would only get automatically discounted upon the release (on some future date) of a <b>B'REL CLASS</b> ship with stats of 5-1-3-3 and a printed cost below 24 SP.

    If a previously-discarded Crew Upgrade is returned to a ship by an effect like <b>SOPEK</b>, any <b>OFFICER CARDS</b> and/or Elite Talent Upgrades that were previously equipped to the Crew Upgrade will stay discarded; only the Crew Upgrade itself returns to the ship.

    Some ships have a forward-facing 45-degree Secondary Firing Arc, including <b>I.K.S. VORN</b>, <b>I.K.S. SUVWL</b>, <b>I.K.S. AMAR</b>, <b>2ND DIVISION BATTLESHIP</b>, <b>K'VORT CLASS</b>, <b>WARBIRD CLASS</b>, and <b>JEM'HADAR BATTLESHIP</b>.
    <br><br>
    If one of these ships uses a Weapon Upgrade such as <b>DISRUPTOR CANNON</b> or <b>AFT PHASE CANNON</b>, with an icon (or card text) indicating it can only be fired through the Secondary Firing Arc or Rear Firing Arc, then that weapon can be fired only through the ship’s forward-facing 45-degree Secondary Firing Arc.
