<br><br>
  

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
The Fremont Reformation group has created this <b>T.R.O.I. Rulings (Card-Specific)</b> repository in order to codify and clarify the latest card-specific rulings for <i>Star Trek: Attack Wing</i> when played in Fremont Reformation events. Other groups are welcome to make use of this repository as well. It is <b><u>NOT</u></b> an official WizKids document. General rules of play can be found in the <b>TROI Rulebook V 2.4</b> link listed above.
<br><br>
This T.R.O.I. Card Specific Rulings repository is split into three main sections, each of which has its own numerical range: <br><br>
<hr>
<b>> 28 - All of the card-specific rulings whose number starts with 28 are summaries of official WizKids rulings, mostly from WORF. All of these rulings have links provided. </b>
<hr> 
<b><p class="blue-text">> 29 - All of the card-specific rulings whose number starts with 29 are clarifications made by the Fremont Reformation Rule Committee for specific cards, in resposne to queries from group members. We believe that they are still adhering strictly to WizKids rules. </p></b>
<hr> 
<b><p class="red-text">> 30 - All of the card-specific rulings whose number starts with 30 are rulings made by TROI in the absence of applicable or acceptable rulings from WizKids. For these rulings, we are unsure whether WizKids would agree with them. You can think of them like "house rules".</p></b>

    In the case that both players have <b>LURIN'S BIRD-OF-PREY</b> and another Ferengi ship with a Ferengi Captain, and both abilites are activated at the start of the Combat Phase, think of "first" and "second" as Captain Skills that are simply above whatever the highest numerical Captain Skill is. Following that logic, resolve this like any other Captain Skill dispute, and the following sequence of combat would take place: <br>
    <br>
    <i>"First" CS Level:</i> <br>
    (a) Ship with Initiative - <b>LURIN'S BIRD-OF-PREY</b> <br>
    (b) Ship without Initiative - <b>LURIN'S BIRD-OF-PREY</b> <br>

    <br><br>
    <b>NYOTA UHURA</b> cannot increase the range of an Upgrade beyond Range 3. Her card text says "Max Range 3" and so the entire combined effect cannot exceed Range 3.

  <b>TEMPORAL CORE</b> cannot be activated by a free action.

  If a card says your ship cannot perform any free actions this round, then you cannot use the card if your ship has already performed a free action this round, and you cannot activate the card via a free action, and once the card has been activated, your ship cannot perform any free actions for the rest of the round.

Using <b>REGENERATION SEQUENCERS</b>, you may repair 1 hull whenever you discard another upgrade on this ship.

    <br><br>

When an oversized <b>BORG CUBE</b> class ship selects a [down arrow] maneuver, it executes this by moving forward and then rotation 90° twice, effectively making it a come-about instead of a reverse. The [down arrow] manuever on these ships therefore has a different meaning than it does for other ships.

    <br><br>

If a ship is forced to disable or discard <b>MANEUVERABILITY</b> while it is overlapping a planet token, treat the ship as if it is overlapping an Obstacle for attack and defending purposes. The ship is not required to select a dial maneuver that immediately clears the planet. If during an Activation Phase the ship is already overlapping the planet token and then does not move far enough to completely clear the planet, or is blocked by another ship, treat it as if the ship overlapped an Obstacle during its maneuver (i.e., skip the Perform Action step and roll an attack die for damage.)

The shields of <b>CUBE 384</b> cannot be dropped, disabled, destroyed, bypassed, or ignored by the effects of enemy Upgrades. 
<br><br>
However, the shields of <b>CUBE 384</b> can be destroyed normally when damage is dealt from an attack. In such a case, it is the attack itself (not the effect of an enemy Upgrade) that is affecting the shields. 
<br><br>
Effects from enemy Upgrades that bypass/ignore shields and deal damage directly to the hull, such as <b>CHRONITON TORPEDOES</b>, do not bypass or ignore the shields of <b>CUBE 384</b>. This is true even if the effect does not directly mention shields. Such damage will first be dealt to any active shields of <b>CUBE 384</b>, as in normal attacks.

The <b>QUEEN VESSEL PRIME</b> ship ability can allow its Captain to gain Borg Drone Tokens exceeding their starting number and thereby increase their Captain Skill arbitrarily high.
<br><br>
This ability also allows non-Borg Captains to gain Drone Tokens.
<br><br>
Drone Tokens on a Captain with a printed Captain Skill do not affect that Captain's Captain Skill. They are only present to pay for effects.

Enemy ships only count as being "in your forward firing arc" if they are also within Range 1-3. Therefore, the <b>SOONG</b> ship ability can still trigger even if there are enemy ships in front of it, as long as those ships are all beyond Range 1-3.

When taking the <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action to perform the action of an Upgrade on another ship as a free action, it is the Upgrade's ship that performs that free action, not the ship taking the <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action.
<br><br>
The <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action cannot target the ship that is taking the <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action, because "friendly ship" does not include your own ship.
<br><br>
The <b>BORG QUEEN</b> action does not allow one Upgrade to have its action performed twice on the same ship in the same round.

The Borg <b>PHOTON TORPEDOES</b> Secondary Weapon may be fired from a primary 360° arc.

<b>BORG MISSILE</b> only destroys Active Shields, not Disabled Shields. If any damage would normally be dealt by the <b>BORG MISSILE</b> attack during the Deal Damage step, then instead: 
<br><br>
(a) Defending ship receives exactly one Auxiliary Power Token. <br>
-- AND -- <br>
(b) For each uncanceled hit or critical hit, one Active Shield (if any remain) on the defending ship is destroyed. Excess hits or critical hits will not deal hull damage to the defending ship.

    <b>TEMPORAL VORTEX</b> forces the attacking player to replay the attack starting with the Roll Attack Dice step of the Combat Phase. The attack is made with the same weapon. But if any bonus dice, rerolling of dice, or conversion of dice were used in the first attempt, they may only be used in the second attempt, they may only be used in the second attempt if they normally could be used again later in a round (such as Scan Tokens). Thus, any cards or tokens that (in the first attempt) were discarded, disabled, marked with time tokens, or spent, will remain discarded, disabled, marked with time tokens, or spent.

When a damage card is placed under the <b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b> card, it goes there before and instead of hitting the hull. Therefore it will not add a token to <b>BORG SHIELD MATRIX</b>, which only gains a token from an attack that damages the shields or hull.

When the defending ship has <b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b>, the attacker rolls their dice, the defender modifies the Critical Hits into Hits, and the attacker may then modify their dice, so TORETH may convert a Hit to a Critical Hit.
<br><br>
<b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b> places the Critical Damage card beneath it. The damage card still resolves its effect even though it is placed beneath the upgrade card. Ongoing effects against the ship (like Stunned Helmsman) do not have any effect due to being on the card rather than the ship. But immediate effects (like Direct Hit!) do occur. The Critical Damage Cards with immediate effects are "Direct Hit!", "Power Disruption", "Munitions Failure", and "Minor Explosion".
<br><br>
When the <b>BORG ABLATIVE HULL ARMOR</b> card is discarded after taking 4 damage, any Critical Damage Cards beneath it are discarded as well.

Even if <b>DISRUPTOR BOMBARDMENT</b> has no time tokens after the first attack, the second attack would need to be with your Primary Weapon or another Weapon Upgrade.
    <br><br>
    A card effect is an optional effect if it has an "ATTACK:" heading, and so <b>DISRUPTOR BOMBARDMENT</b> is an optional effect.  Optional effects may only be used once per round per ship per card, unless they are WHEN ATTACKING, WHEN DEFENDING, or EACH AND EVERY TIME effects.

    The game text that provides how to flip the face down cards is on <b>KHAN SINGH'S</b> card.  While he is Disabled or Discarded, the face down cards may not be flipped or used (as they have no game text without being flipped).

    You may not place, for example, <b>ENERGY DISSIPATOR</b> on a non-Breen ship under <b>KHAN SINGH</b>, because its text counts as part of its printed cost.  So its printed cost would actually be 5+5=10 and therefore too high.

    If an Upgrade granting additional shields is hidden beneath <b>QUARK</b> on your ship, and is then revealed, the current number of shield tokens assigned to your ship would not change.  However, you could subsequently repair your shields to a new maximum value.

    When determining whether it is legal to place a particular card face down beneath <b>QUARK</b>, you consider the cost of the Upgrade as if you were purchasing it for the ship.  Faction penalties and extra card costs are factored into whether you can place a card beneath <b>QUARK</b>.  Discounts to SP costs can be applied to the card underneath <b>QUARK</b> to make it fulfill the requirements to go under <b>QUARK</b>.
    <br><br>
    Variable cost cards such as <b>DORSAL PHASER ARRAY</b> may not ever be placed under <b>QUARK</b> because they do not have a defined SP cost.  When a card does not have a defined SP cost it may not be affected by, or used with, cards that require it to have a SP value.

    Treat the <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b> as a ship with "universal" faction when considering the cost of any upgrade to place under <b>QUARK</b> if he is on your <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b>. There is no faction penalty but other card text based penalties or restrictions would apply. Example, <b>QUARK</b> on <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b> cannot place <b>CLOAKING DEVICE</b> because the additional cost specified on the <b>CLOAKING DEVICE</b> card would make the upgrade too expensive for <b>QUARK’S</b> limits. The upgrade underneath <b>QUARK</b> is part of his own point cost and does not count toward the 20 points of captain and upgrades that are purchased for the <b>REINFORCEMENTS SIDEBOARD</b>.

    When you target another ship with <b>THOUGHT MAKER</b>, the opposing player does not see what maneuver the dial was set to until it is time to reveal the targeted ship's dial.  At that point, they decide whether or not to place an Auxiliary Power Token in order to not move.

    <b>TOM PARIS</b> does not allow you to roll defense dice, if you are already rolling no defense dice thanks to effects such as <b>BORG MISSILE</b> or <b>NANCLUS</b>.

    If your ship is rolling -2 attack dice due to using <b>PROJECTED STASIS FIELD</b> earlier in the round, and then it attacks with <b>TORPEDO FUSILLADE</b>, the -2 attack dice modifier is applied to the first of the attack rolls that <b>TORPEDO FUSILLADE</b> grants.
    <br><br>
    When a card ability forces a player to roll fewer attack dice "this round", the player must roll fewer attack dice in total during that round's Combat Phase, starting with the very next time the player rolls attack dice during the Combat Phase.

    <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b> triggers from any movement by your ship (which might be the execution of a maneuver or it might be a Sensor Echo) within Range 1 of the Minefield Token, even if your ship completely exits the trigger area by the end of the movement.  Therefore, <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b> triggers if any part of the ship's base is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token before it moves, or after its final landing position is established at the end of the movement, or both.  And even if neither of these is true, it still triggers if any part of the template used to execute a maneuver is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token.  However, if the maneuver template used to perform a Sensor Echo is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token, that does not suffice on its own to trigger <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b>, as the maneuver template used for a Sensor Echo is not part of "movement".
    <br><br>
    Your ship can trigger <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b> multiple times during a round, for example during execution of a maneuver, and/or performing a Sensor Echo, and/or or additional movement granted by a special ability.
    <br><br>
    After your ship triggers <b>VERTERON PULSE TRAP</b>, an Auxiliary Power Token is immediately placed beside your ship.  You then proceed to the Check For Power Strain step, where Auxiliary Power Tokens may be added or removed depending on the color of the maneuver that was executed.  If this is the initial dial-based maneuver, any "after you move" abilities happen after the Check For Power Strain Step is completed, followed by the Perform Action Step for the active ship.

    <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> triggers if any part of the enemy ship's base is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token after its landing position is established at the end of movement, or if any part of the template used to execute a maneuver is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token.  However, if you start your movement (either a maneuver or a Sensor Echo) already in range of the Minefield Token, and your movement takes you out of Range 1, then <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> does not trigger.  If the maneuver template used to perform a Sensor Echo is within Range 1 of the Minefield Token, that does not suffice on its own to trigger <b>CLOAKED MINES</b>, as that template is not considered to be part of "movement".
    <br><br>
    The effect of <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> allows you to immediately perform a Scan Action "out of sequence" in order to reduce the damage dice roll.  This choice happens before proceeding to the Check For Power Strain step.  The removal of an Auxiliary Power Token from performing a Green Maneuver has not happened yet, so if you already have an Auxiliary Power Token when triggering <b>CLOAKED MINES</b>, you cannot elect to perform a Scan Action "out of sequence", even if you have just executed a Green Maneuver.  Conversely, if you do not have an Auxiliary Power Token and you performed a Red Maneuver that triggered <b>CLOAKED MINES</b>, you have not yet placed an Auxiliary Power Token by your ship from the Red Maneuver, and so you still may elect to perform a Scan Action "out of sequence", prior to receiving the Auxiliary Power Token.
    <br><br>
    Once you have decided whether to perform the "out of sequence" Scan Action, you continue the <b>CLOAKED MINES</b> effect and roll the appropriate number of dice for damage.  Then you proceed to the Check For Power Strain Step, where Auxiliary Power Tokens may be added or removed depending on the color of the executed maneuver.  If this is the initial dial-based maneuver, any "after you move" abilities happen after the Check For Power Strain Step is completed, and you then proceed to the Perform Action Step for the active ship.

Thus the existing <b>KLINGON STARSHIP</b> was discounted from 20 SP to 13 SP because it is also a <b>B'REL CLASS</b> ship with stats of 4-1-3-2, although there were differences in Factions and slots.
    <br><br>
    By contrast, the existing <b>KLINGON/BORG STARSHIP</b> was not automatically discounted from 24 SP.  The discount to 13 SP would only apply if the existing ship had identical stats of 4-1-3-2 to the <b>FERENGI/KLINGON STARSHIP</b>, whereas the <b>KLINGON/BORG STARSHIP</b> has stats of 5-1-3-3.  It would only get automatically discounted upon the release (on some future date) of a <b>B'REL CLASS</b> ship with stats of 5-1-3-3 and a printed cost below 24 SP.

    When deciding whether it is legal to place an Upgrade face-down beneath DAIMON SOLOK, LEONARD MCCOY, EXPERIMENTAL TORPEDO BAY, or INTEGRATED FUTURE TECHNOLOGY, you can normally ignore any +1 faction penalty on the face down Upgrade, because Printed Cost does not include faction penalties.  However, if this happens on a shuttlecraft, the Upgrade must still be legally equippable to the ship.  Any faction penalties for the face down Upgrade would still apply when determining its cost, and thus its legality to be equipped on a shuttlecraft.  Therefore, if being placed face-down on a shuttlecraft, the Upgrade's cost (after applying all discounts and cost penalties) must still be 3 SP or less, in addition to meeting the requirement for its Printed Cost.

      The triangular Guide Token that is placed behind your Tholian Ship, when it performs an ENERGY WEB Action, functions like a friendly ENERGY WEB Token (EWT) "stick" as long as the triangular Guide Token remains on the board.  Thus it counts as an EWT for its own side when determining how many dice to roll for damage inflicted on a non-Tholian ship by EWT's, and acts as an obstacle if non-Tholian ships (friendly or enemy) overlap it, move through it, or fire through it.

      When performing an ENERGY WEB Action from a Tholian ship, you cannot change your facing by 60 degrees (using the triangular Guide Tokens) if that would cause you to overlap another ship base (other than an Oversized Borg Cube) or a planet.  And similarly to echoing, you can freely experiment with changing your facing by 60 degrees and then changing your mind, but if you measure range or check firing arc once you are in the new position, you have committed to that new position.

      CAPTURED can be transferred from one ship to another by effects like ESCAPE TRANSPORTER or a shuttle card transfer, which immediately transfers the effect of CAPTURED to its new ship.  If other cards are also being transferred to the new ship at the same time, and any of those cards can only be equipped to an Independent ship, this restriction is immediately satisfied by the presence of CAPTURED, and such cards are not discarded.

      When using IBIX DYNASTY, you must discard any one Weapon Upgrade from your ship.  It does not need to be a weapon from one of the two Weapon slots added by IBIX DYNASTY.
      <br><br>
      Although the card text says "If this card is discarded, your ship loses these Upgrade slots", that text has no real meaning anymore, under current rules.  As soon as the game starts, all Upgrade slots that were added by cards will immediately disappear anyway, even before IBIX DYNASTY is used.  And all cards (including Weapon Upgrades) that were initially equipped to the ship, will stay equipped, even if their slots disappear.
      <br><br>
      So the net result is that if you use IBIX DYNASTY, you must discard IBIX DYNASTY and any one Weapon Upgrade of your choice that is equipped to your ship.  But all other Weapon Upgrades will stay equipped to your ship even after you discard IBIX DYNASTY.

      If DAHAR MASTER becomes inactive while still equipped to a Captain, then at the start of the next phase, he loses all skill bonuses that he was previously gaining from any DAHAR MASTER cards in his fleet.  This would happen, for example, if the Captain and/or his DAHAR MASTER Elite Talent becomes disabled, or if his DAHAR MASTER Elite Talent gains Time Token(s), or if their ship receives an INJURED CAPTAIN critical damage card.
      <br><br>
      However, for other Captains in the fleet who also have DAHAR MASTER, their Captain Skills would not be affected by this.  Even if DAHAR MASTER is inactive, it still counts as a "copy of Dahar Master in your fleet" as long as it is still in your fleet.
      <br><br>
      Whenever DAHAR MASTER becomes active again, then the Captain will resume gaining its skill bonuses again, once the next phase has begun. 
      <br><br>
      Of course, if DAHAR MASTER is discarded or its ship is destroyed, then it ceases to provide any skill bonus to other Captains in the fleet who also have DAHAR MASTER, once the next phase has begun.

      When you are attacking with FULL POWER PHASER BARRAGE, the three extra dice can be rolled during the Deal Damage step even if the card is not assigned to a Constitution Class ship.
      <br><br>
      Those dice cannot be converted, because you are already done with the Modify Attack Dice step by the time they are rolled.
      <br><br>
      They are also not subject to the Rule of 3; assuming there are at least two uncanceled hit or critical hit results, you get to roll all three of them.

      When attacking a ship that has used PICARD MANEUVER earlier in the round, your attack roll is modified by -4 attack dice thanks to PICARD MANEUVER.  However, due to the Rule of 3, an attack roll cannot ultimately be reduced by more than 3 dice, even if the sum of all modifiers would result in a reduction of more than 3 dice.
      <br><br>
      For example, if there are no other modifiers, then when attacking the ship that used PICARD MANEUVER, you would roll 3 fewer attack dice.  In contrast, if you also had a +2 attack dice modifier, then you would roll 2 fewer attack dice instead (+2 combined with -4, giving a total of -2).

      The QUANTUM TORPEDOES ability, adding 1 normal hit result for each critical hit result that was rolled, occurs during the Roll Attack Dice Step.  Therefore, if you re-roll and/or convert attack dice during the Modify Attack Dice Step, any resultant critical hit results would not trigger the QUANTUM TORPEDOES ability to add more normal hits, because the Roll Attack Dice Step would already have completed.
      <br><br>
      Other than naturally rolling critical hit results, the only way to trigger extra hits for QUANTUM TORPEDOES would be with card abilities that already produce critical hit results by the end of the Roll Attack Dice Step.

      For example, if you are making two attack rolls in a round, you could use the bonuses as soon as they are gained, thereby gaining +1 attack die for the first attack and +1 attack die for the second attack.  Or you could decide to postpone the +1 attack die granted from the first attack, which would leave you rolling no extra attack dice for the first attack, and +2 attack dice for the second attack.

      When a card ability allows a player to gain a certain number of attack dice "this game round" it allows the player to add that many attack dice (in total) to their attack rolls during that round's Combat Phase. If a player is able to make multiple attacks during the same Combat Phase, the player may choose when to add the bonus attack dice.

   AMBUSH ATTACK and PATIENCE IS FOR THE DEAD are discarded at the start of the Combat Phase and give an attack order level of Before All Other Ships.  The ROMULAN COMMANDER Action also gives an attack order level of Before All Other Ships.  This attack level goes before LURIN'S BIRD OF PREY, which assigns attack order levels of First and Second.  The LEYTON Action gives an attack order level of Last for the targeted ship, which will attack after all numerical Captain Skill levels.

   For any ship that is given attack order levels by multiple replacement effects, such as both LEYTON and LURIN'S BIRD OF PREY, the ship's controlling player can choose the order that the replacement effects are applied in, with the eventual attacking order determined by the last one applied.

    You can take multiple free actions including the use of the U.S.S. HATHAWAY ability, if they are available.  For example, you could take a free Scan Action with JEAN-LUC PICARD, then an Evade Action with the ship, and then use the ship ability to take another action bar action and receive an Auxiliary Power Token after.  The ship's free action from the U.S.S. HATHAWAY ability does not need to be exactly the "second Action" in sequence.

Rather, it ensures that the friendly ship will still get its Perform Action step even if it bumps. If that friendly ship no long has an Auxiliary Power Token at that point, it willl be able to perform action(s) during its Perform Action step. Typically this will be accomplished by the friendly ship having executed a green maneuver to remove that Auxiliary Power Token.

    Stat adjustments from an Upgrade such as COMBAT VESSEL VARIANT apply during fleet construction and may impact whether certain upgrades can be assigned to the same ship.  For example, COMBAT VESSEL VARIANT might increase a ship's Primary Weapon Value from 3 to 4 and thereby prevent you from also equipping TYPE 8 PHASER ARRAY or UPGRADED PHASERS.
    <br><br>
    In addition, the stat adjustments from an Upgrade such as COMBAT VESSEL VARIANT do not count toward the Rule of Three.  It should be treated as a replacement effect to the new numbers, similarly to how cloaking works with Agility.

    When attacking a Borg ship that has a 360-degree primary firing arc, VALDORE would always be considered to be outside of the Borg ship's forward firing arc.
    <br><br>
    Any Upgrade (or special ability) that references a firing arc on another ship functions against a ship with a 360-degree firing arc as if that ship does not have a firing arc, and VALDORE does reference a firing arc on another ship.

    <br><br>
    When equipped to a Borg ship that has a 360-degree primary firing arc, VALDORE still functions.
    <br><br>
    If your ship has a 360-degree firing arc, any card deployed to your ship that references a firing arc on your ship does not function.  However, VALDORE does not reference a firing arc on his own ship.

    If a non-Tholian ship's movement causes its ship base and/or movement template to overlap one or more ENERGY WEB Tokens (EWT's), whether those are friendly or enemy EWT's, that triggers a separate damage dice roll for each EWT that is overlapped.  Each dice roll is based on the EWT-owning player's full complement of EWT's currently on the board, including any triangular Guide Tokens.
    <br><br>
    For example, if your non-Tholian ship overlaps two of your EWT's and your template overlaps one of your opponent's EWT's, you would do two full damage dice rolls based on how many EWT's you have on the board, and one full damage dice roll based on how many EWT's your opponent has on the board.

    Although the ENERGY WEB Action requires that your ship has performed a 1-straight maneuver this game round, it is not necessary for that 1-straight to have been your dial-based-maneuver or your latest maneuver. You just need to have performed a 1-straight at some point during the game round.

    If you have accepted negotiations with KORRD and are planning the maneuver face up during the Planning Phase for the ship targeted by KORRD, you can request that dials be set in their proper order.  Dials are set in ascending CS skill order, exactly like activation order for ships.  Thus some dial settings might already be committed by the time the targeted ship sets its maneuver face up.
    <br><br>
    Once the Planning Phase has completed, you can flip the targeted ship's dial face-down before proceeding to the Activation Phase (after first making sure the opponent has seen the chosen maneuver).
    <br><br>
    If LURE is played against the ship targeted by KORRD, the dial will be placed face-down after changing the maneuver per LURE, and the dial will stay face-down until it is revealed during the Activation Phase.

    The "out of sequence" Scan Action to reduce the damage roll from CLOAKED MINES does not have to be the Scan Action from your ship's Action Bar.

    EZRI DAX does not reduce the number of Time Tokens being moved onto ROBERT APRIL when his ability is used.
    <br><br>
    The Time Tokens being moved from the targeted Crew Upgrade onto ROBERT APRIL are being "moved", not "placed".

    You can target an Upgrade equipped to another ship, and place a BIO-MIMETIC GEL TOKEN (BMGT) on that Upgrade, even if it already has one or more BMGT's on it.
    <br><br>
    Although your ship must be within Range 1-2 of another ship in order to target one of that ship's Upgrades and place a BMGT on it, you do not need to be within any particular range of that ship or that Upgrade in order to spend the BMGT that is on the Upgrade.
    <br><br>
    Even after the BIO-MIMETIC GEL Upgrade has been discarded, any BMGT's that were already placed can still be spent normally by the ship that placed them.

    KANG must already have an enemy ship target-locked in order to use his ability.  However, that does not have to be the enemy ship that is currently attacking KANG.
    <br><br>
    When using his ability, KANG spends the blue Target Lock Token that is beside his own ship, and also removes the corresponding red Target Lock Token from the target-locked enemy ship.

    JULIAN BASHIR's effect works (for the rest of the round) as long as his ship is in play.  The targeted ship may only attack JULIAN BASHIR's ship and no other ship, as long as it remains on the table.
    <br><br>
    If an attacking ship has been targeted by JULIAN BASHIR, it cannot use a card providing multiple attacks if that would mean targeting more than his ship.
    <br><br>
    For any card providing additional attacks, the additional attack would still have to target JULIAN BASHIR's ship if it remains on the table, but is free to target other viable ships if his ship is no longer in play.

    The ship ability for TWILIGHT'S WRATH only triggers once per round.  A card effect is an optional effect if it contains the phrase "you may", and optional effects may only be used once per round per ship per card, unless they are WHEN ATTACKING, WHEN DEFENDING, or EACH AND EVERY TIME effects. 
    <br><br>
    The additional Sensor Echo Action can be taken immediately after the opposing ship's action resolves, or can instead be saved until the Perform Action step for TWILIGHT'S WRATH.

    <br><br>
   
    IMPROVED CLOAKING allows your ship to be cloaked while still having some Active Shields.  The ship does not have to disable any Active Shields during the End Phase in order to stay cloaked.
    <br><br>
    During the End Phase, Cloak Tokens still on their green sides may stay in play if their owners elect to keep their Disabled Shields being disabled (rather than flipping them to their Active sides).  
    <br><br>
    Active Shields are never disabled during the End Phase unless an ability specifically requires it.

    B-4 cannot place time tokens on the Captain of a non-Federation ship even if that ship has "Enterprise" in its name.

    <br><br>
   
    If T'RUL equips the ROMULAN CLOAKING DEVICE to her ship for 0 SP, that is a replacement effect that can then be modified normally by a faction penalty and the +2 penalty for non-Romulan ships.
    <br><br>
    For example, T'RUL equipping ROMULAN CLOAKING DEVICE on a non-Romulan ship would typically result in a cost of 3 SP for T'RUL and 3 SP for ROMULAN CLOAKING DEVICE.

    <br><br>
   
    When a ship attacks with FLANKING ATTACK and is not in the primary firing arc of the defending ship, the defending ship rolls -2 defense dice even if the attacking ship is not a Valdore Class.
    <br><br>
    FLANKING ATTACK requires that it be equipped to a Valdore Class in order to provide an increase in attacking dice, but that is a separate effect (there is a horizontal line dividing the two effects).

    FLEET COORDINATION cannot extend the range of the ability for the ship it is equipped to, even if that ship ability affects friendly ships at range 2.

    If a ship with TYPE 10 PHASERS is attacking with its primary weapon against a ship with no Active Shields, the attacking ship rolls +1 attack die and also converts up to 2 blank results into battlestations results.

    MONTGOMERY SCOTT can target his own ship, or another ship (friendly or opposing) within Range 1-2, as long as the target ship has a Starship Construction Card equipped to it.
    <br><br>
    As a general rule, when targeting ships within a specified range, you cannot target your own ship.  We view this as a misprinted card.  The full action should be read as:
    <br><br>
    ACTION: Place 2 Time Tokens on this card and target another ship within range (or this ship) that has a Starship Construction Card equipped.

    <br><br>
   
    The U.S.S. AKIRA's first ability, to relocate its Red Target Lock token onto a different opposing ship at the start of the Combat Phase, is not a Target Lock Action, and may be used even if the U.S.S. AKIRA performed a Target Lock Action earlier in the round or has an Auxilary Power Token beside it.
    <br><br>
    The U.S.S. AKIRA's second ability, to acquire a target lock on the defending ship during the DEAL DAMAGE step, is a Target Lock Action and therefore must follow the normal rules for the Target Lock Action, including these restrictions:
     <br>
     - cannot perform the action if your ship has an Auxiliary Power Token;
     <br>
     - cannot perform the action if your ship already performed a Target Lock Action this round;
     <br>
     - cannot acquire the Target Lock on a ship that has been cloaked since the previous round;

    <br><br>
   
    When your ship performs ALYNNA NECHAYEV's Fleet Action, your own ship's Captain Skill is only impacted if it has a Captain equipped with a printed Captain Skill number of 5 or less.

    <br><br>
   
    The older (retail) SCIMITAR ability, having text starting with "After you attack while Cloaked", is optional and can only be used once per round.
    <br><br>
    A card effect is an optional effect if it requires you to pay a cost in order to activate the effect, such as placing an Auxiliary Power Token.  Optional effects may only be used once per round per ship per card, unless they are WHEN ATTACKING, WHEN DEFENDING, or EACH AND EVERY TIME effects.

    The newer (faction pack) SCIMITAR ability, having text starting with "WHEN ATTACKING", is optional and can be used multiple times in a round.
    <br><br>
    A card effect is an optional effect if it requires you to pay a cost in order to activate the effect, such as placing an Auxiliary Power Token.  However, WHEN ATTACKING effects may be used multiple times per round, even if they are optional effects.
    <br><br>
    For example, if the SCIMITAR were making three attack rolls in a round, it could use its ability three times, each time placing an Auxiliary Power Token by the ship when attacking in order to keep its Cloak Token from flipping to its red side.  It would end up with three Auxiliary Power Tokens from doing that, but its Cloak Token would stay on its green side.

    <br><br>
   
    If you have LESKIT equipped to a ship with an Auxiliary Power Token beside it, and you reveal a Red Maneuver, you can use LESKIT to treat that maneuver as a Green Maneuver.  This allows you to execute the revealed maneuver rather than having your opponent choose your ship's maneuver.
    <br><br>
    In addition, the optional free Echo Action granted to LESKIT happens after executing the green maneuver and removing an Auxiliary Power Token, which would make it possible to perform the free Echo Action if that had been the only Auxiliary Power Token beside the ship.
